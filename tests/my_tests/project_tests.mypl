#Good project testing ideas
#1 Test the Step key "s"
#2 Test the quit key which is any nonbinded key
#3 Test the skip to end key which is Q
#4 Test the project by setting breakpoints using 'b' at the initial screen and the skipping to them with 'Q'
#5 Test the project on a lot of the test files, starting with basic-functions
